# Agent Guidelines

This is a **static website** using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Rules

- **DO NOT** introduce frameworks (React, Vue, build tools, etc.)
- **DO NOT** change the project structure
- **ONLY** edit plain `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files
- Keep the current folder structure: `index.html`, `assets/css/`, `assets/js/`, `assets/images/`

Unless explicitly requested by the user to do otherwise.
